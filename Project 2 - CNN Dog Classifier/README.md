Project 2 - Convolutional Neural Networks - Dog Breed Classifier

Here is the official Project overview

"Project Overview
Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! 

In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. 
Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. 
If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. 
Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, you will make important design decisions about 
the user experience for your app.

By completing this lab, you demonstrate your understanding of the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models 
designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. 
Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems 
without a perfect answer.

Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!"


This project tasks the user with creating their own CNN while justifying each componenet in the network.
This network is trained on the image dataset and the accuracy is noted. 

Afterwards, transfer learning is used to modify one of pytorch's pre-existing networks.
This network is then tested on the image dataset and the accuracy is noted. 

Finally, the transfer learning model is used to create an algorithm that can identify dog breeds from images. 

6 pictures in total are used for this project. 2 human pictures, 2 dog pictures and 2 that are neither dog nor human pictures.
