# Project 4 Seinfeld TV Scripts

In this project, you will use a recurrent neural network to generate new lines for a seinfeld script from a text corpus. 

The deep learning technique that will be used here is called a Recurrent Neural Network. These types of networks have the ability to perform very
well on Time Series data. As a result, Recurrent Neural Networks are great for language translation, natural language processing, speech recognition and 
image captioning.

They have something referred to as a memory. That is to say that the results of hidden layer calculations can be used to process future inputs. Humans see sequences every day and as such in order to effectively recreate human capabilities in a computer, one needs to be able to impart memory to a piece of code. RNN's do a great job of being able to predict the future from the past. 


## Code Explanation 




Just download the repo and run the files on your local computer. Its recommended though to use google collaboratory as there is a free GPU that can be used there.
