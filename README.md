Deep Learning nanodegree projects


This is my DeepLearning Nanodegree project repository. All of my work will end up in this repository. 
 

## Unit 2 - Neural Networks Project: Predicting bike rentals

This folder has the project for predicting bike rentals using a neural network. I needed to implement the backpropagation algorithm, the forward and backward pass, as well as the sigmoid function.  

## Unit 3 - Convulutional neural networks : Dog breed classifier 

This folder contains the project for identifying dog breeds from photos. It can also be used on human images to show what dog breed is closest to what is shown in the image. This project had me developing a CNN which stands for a Convolutional Neural Network which is used in classifying images. 

## unit 4 - Recurrent Neural Networks : Seinfeld TV script generation

This folder contains the project for generating a tv script using a text corpus from the show seinfeld. The result generated can be seen in the folder. This project uses recurrent neural networks which are basically neural networks with a memory. The results of previous inputs can influence future inputs. The past can be used to predict the future....

## Unit 5 - Generative Adversarial Networks - Generating faces

This folder contains the project for generating faces. This project uses a generator and a discriminator network. The generator creates images that you want to create and the discriminator has to determine which of those images are not real. The generator has to get better at creating images in order to beat the discriminator. At the end, the images made are nearly identical to what would be seen in real life. 

## Unit 6 - Model Deployment - Sentiment analysis model on sagemaker

This folder contains the project for creating a sentiment analysis model and then deploying it on sagemaker.
