# DeepLearning-Nanodegree
Deep Learning nanodegree projects


This is my DeepLearning Nanodegree project repository. All of my work will end up in this repository. 


Unit 1 - Neural Networks

This folder contains a project that uses a simple neural network to predict bike renting patterns. 

Unit 2 - Convulutional neural networks

This folder contains the project for identifying dog breeds from photos. It can also be used on human images to show what dog breed is closest to what is shown in the image. 

unit 3 - Recurrent Neural Networks 

This folder contains the project for generating a tv script using a text corpus from the show seinfeld. The result generated can be seen in the folder. 

Unit 4 - Generative Adversarial Networks

This folder contains the project for generating faces. 

Unit 5 - Model Deployment

This folder contains the project for creating a sentiment analysis model and then deploying it on sagemaker
