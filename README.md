Deep Learning nanodegree projects


This is my DeepLearning Nanodegree project repository. All of my work will end up in this repository. 
 

Unit 2 - Neural Networks Project: Predicting bike rentals

Unit 3 - Convulutional neural networks : Dog breed classifier 

This folder contains the project for identifying dog breeds from photos. It can also be used on human images to show what dog breed is closest to what is shown in the image. 

unit 4 - Recurrent Neural Networks : Seinfeld TV script generation

This folder contains the project for generating a tv script using a text corpus from the show seinfeld. The result generated can be seen in the folder. 

Unit 5 - Generative Adversarial Networks - Generating faces

This folder contains the project for generating faces. 

Unit 6 - Model Deployment - Sentiment analysis model on sagemaker

This folder contains the project for creating a sentiment analysis model and then deploying it on sagemaker
